# Range of Domains

The two datasets required for this analysis were the [list of .nyc registered domains](https://github.com/PerplexCity/Range_of_Domain/blob/master/nyc_Domain_Registrations%20(2).csv), which the [NYC Open Data portal provides](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/-nyc-Domain-Registrations/9cw8-7heb/data), and the [list of the 10,000 most frequent words](https://github.com/PerplexCity/Range_of_Domain/blob/master/topwords_2.csv), which [GitHub user worldwisdom compiled](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english).

The [analysis and visualizations were done in R](https://github.com/PerplexCity/Range_of_Domain/blob/master/domain_length.R), as per usual.
